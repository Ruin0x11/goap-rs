# goap-rs
An implementation of [Goal-Oriented Action Planning](http://web.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/goap.html) in Rust, with a generic A* trait.

Requires nightly, only because associated constants are feature-gated. You can hardcode the maximum number of A* computations to use it in stable.

## Usage
Check the test modules for usage examples.
